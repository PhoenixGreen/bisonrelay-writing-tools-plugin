// morphy.go reduces a word as typed to the form the datasets are keyed by.
//
// This is the difference between a thesaurus that answers and one that mostly
// does not. WordNet and MyThes both store base forms only -- "cat" and not
// "cats", "run" and not "running", "happy" and not "happier" -- so of the
// 121,000 words the dictionary knows, only 77,000 have an entry to look up
// directly. The other 44,000 are almost all inflections of a word that is
// there, plus 27,000 possessives, and reducing them is the whole job.
//
// The rules are WordNet's own (its "Morphy" component): a table of suffix
// detachments per part of speech, plus an exception list for the forms no
// rule reaches -- went/go, children/child, better/good. The exception list
// ships with WordNet and is generated into exceptions.txt by tools/mkdefs.
//
// Every candidate is checked against the data before it is accepted, so a
// wrong guess costs nothing: "sing" does not become "s" because "s" has no
// entry, and "axes" is tried as both "axe" and "ax".

// detachment is one suffix rule: strip Suffix, append Replace.
