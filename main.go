// Command bisonrelay-writing-tools-plugin is a Bison Relay dynamic-wasm plugin
// providing two capabilities:
//
//   - spellcheck-data: a dictionary for the requested language, a set of
//     writing rules and a set of declared analysis checks, handed over once
//     when the plugin is enabled and again whenever the language changes.
//     Every match and every count after that happens in the app; there is no
//     per-keystroke work here.
//   - thesaurus: synonyms and definitions for one word, answered on demand.
//     This data stays in the plugin -- at 10MB it is far too much to push
//     across for a feature used a word at a time. The word asked about is
//     reduced to the base form the data is keyed by before it is searched.
//
// It is headless -- no nav item, no screens -- so beyond the `alloc` export
// every plugin must provide, it implements only those two capabilities'
// exports.
//
// That also means the plugin never sees a word anyone types. It has no
// network and no filesystem access, and needs neither.
//
// This file is only the WebAssembly plumbing; the content lives in package
// spellcheck. Build with build.sh (GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build
// -buildmode=c-shared); see wasmhost's package doc in the bisonrelay repo
// for the ABI it implements.
